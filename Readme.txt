I have created a news scraping application. URL of any website can be put into news-scrapper.py. 

The python script will fetch all the URLs present on the news site. 

Then it will fetch all the titles and texts on the given URLs

It will also fetch the urls of the image related to the given story

Unfortunately, I wasn't able to show the imagees but just the urls of the image.
